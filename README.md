# Golem Engineering
This course provides a framework for building statistical models ("Golems") as formal tools to reason about a complex world. We begin by reframing hypothesis testing not as a simple verdict against a "zombie" null model, but as a comparison between competing, plausible Golems. A core challenge we address is that real-world data is filtered through messy and biased measurement processes, such as uneven sampling effort. Instead of discarding precious data through traditional standardization methods like rarefaction, we advocate for building smarter models that are explicitly taught about this data-generating process. This leads us to the powerful solution of mixed-effect models—Golems with memory—that account for data structures and biases to make more robust and honest inferences. Ultimately, this course teaches a unified approach to building generative models that respect both our scientific ideas and the reality of how data is collected.
