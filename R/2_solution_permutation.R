# breaking apart any potential relationship between diversity and size while keeping the characteristics 
# of the data

sample(dat_div$size, size = nrow(dat_div), replace = FALSE)

# now that we have 100 permutated datasets, we can setup a new loop that fits a lm for each, 
# and extracts the slope value, but first we need to setup a new list with 100 slots for the slopes

# now we have 100 slope values created under the null hypothesis. We can get them into a vector
# by applying unlist() to the list_slopes. Save this into vec_slopes
vec_slopes <- unlist(list_slopes)

# how does our empirical slope value (dat_coef[[2]]) compare to this distribution? Can we reject
